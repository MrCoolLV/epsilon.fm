Our modern open-source platform includes features like an artist website, social media management, and merch, empowering you with global reach and full control over your creative work.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the code and installed dependencies with `bun install`, you can start the development server as follows:

```bash
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app:

```bash
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.
